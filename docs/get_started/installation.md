# Installation ðŸŽ¬

At the moment Stoix is not meant to be installed as a library, but rather to be used as a research tool.

You can use Stoix by cloning the repo and pip installing as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdanToledo/Stoix.git
cd Stoix
pip install -e .
```

We have tested `Stoix` on Python 3.10. Note that because the installation of JAX differs depending on your hardware accelerator,
we advise users to explicitly install the correct JAX version (see the [official installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)).
