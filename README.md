## Welcome to Stoix! üèõÔ∏è

Stoix provides simplified code for quickly iterating on ideas in single-agent reinforcement learning with useful implementations of popular single-agent RL algorithms in JAX allowing for easy parallelisation across devices with JAX's `pmap`. All implementations are fully compiled with JAX's `jit` thus making training and environment execution very fast. However, this does require environments written in JAX. For environments not written in JAX, Stoix offers Sebulba systems (see below). Algorithms and their default hyperparameters have not been hyper-optimised for any specific environment and are useful as a starting point for research and/or for initial baselines.

To join us in these efforts, please feel free to reach out, raise issues or read our [contribution guidelines](#contributing-) (or just star üåü to stay up to date with the latest developments)!

Stoix is fully in JAX with substantial speed improvement compared to other popular libraries. We currently provide native support for the [Jumanji][jumanji] environment API and wrappers for popular RL environments.

## System Design Paradigms
Stoix offers two primary system design paradigms (Podracer Architectures) to cater to different research and deployment needs:

- **Anakin:** Traditional Stoix implementations are fully end-to-end compiled with JAX, focusing on speed and simplicity with native JAX environments. This design paradigm is ideal for setups where all components, including environments, can be optimized using JAX, leveraging the full power of JAX's pmap and jit. For an illustration of the Anakin architecture, see this [figure](docs/images/anakin_arch.jpg) from the [Mava][mava] technical report.

- **Sebulba:** The Sebulba system introduces flexibility by allowing different devices to be assigned specifically for learning and acting. In this setup, acting devices serve as inference servers for multiple parallel environments, which can be written in any framework, not just JAX. This enables Stoix to be used with a broader range of environments while still benefiting from JAX's speed. For an illustration of the Sebulba architecture, see this [animation](docs/images/sebulba_arch.gif) from the [InstaDeep Sebulba implementation](https://github.com/instadeepai/sebulba/).

Not all implementations have both Anakin and Sebulba implementations but effort has gone into making the two implementations as similar as possible to allow easy conversion.

## Code Philosophy üßò

The current code in Stoix was initially **largely** taken and subsequently adapted from [Mava][mava]. As Mava develops, Stoix will hopefully adopt their optimisations that are relevant for single-agent RL. Like Mava, Stoix is not designed to be a highly modular library and is not meant to be imported. Our repository focuses on simplicity and clarity in its implementations while utilising the advantages offered by JAX such as `pmap` and `vmap`, making it an excellent resource for researchers and practitioners to build upon. Stoix follows a similar design philosophy to [CleanRL][cleanrl] and [PureJaxRL][purejaxrl], where we allow for some code duplication to enable readability, easy reuse, and fast adaptation. A notable difference between Stoix and other single-file libraries is that Stoix makes use of abstraction where relevant. It is not intended to be purely educational with research utility as the primary focus. In particular, abstraction is currently used for network architectures, environments, logging, and evaluation.

## Overview ü¶ú

### Stoix TLDR
1. **Algorithms:** Stoix offers easily hackable, single-file implementations of popular algorithms in pure JAX. You can vectorize algorithm training on a single device using `vmap` as well as distribute training across multiple devices with `pmap` (or both). Multi-host support (i.e., vmap/pmap over multiple devices **and** machines) is coming soon! All implementations include checkpointing to save and resume parameters and training runs.

2. **System Designs:** Choose between Anakin systems for fully JAX-optimized workflows or Sebulba systems for flexibility with non-JAX environments.

3. **Hydra Config System:** Leverage the Hydra configuration system for efficient and consistent management of experiments, network architectures, and environments. Hydra facilitates the easy addition of new hyperparameters and supports multi-runs and Optuna hyperparameter optimization. No more need to create large bash scripts to run a series of experiments with differing hyperparameters, network architectures or environments.

4. **Advanced Logging:** Stoix features advanced and configurable logging, ready for output to the terminal, TensorBoard, and other ML tracking dashboards (WandB and Neptune). It also supports logging experiments in JSON format ready for statistical tests and generating RLiable plots (see the plotting notebook). This enables statistically confident comparisons of algorithms natively.

Stoix currently offers the following building blocks for Single-Agent RL research:

### Environment Wrappers üç¨
Stoix offers wrappers for:

- **JAX environments:** [Gymnax][gymnax], [Jumanji][jumanji], [Brax][brax], [XMinigrid][xminigrid], [Craftax][craftax], [POPJym][popjym], [Navix][navix] and even [JAXMarl][jaxmarl] (although using Centralised Controllers).
- **Non-JAX environments:** [Envpool][envpool] and [Gymnasium][gymnasium].

### Statistically Robust Evaluation üß™
Stoix natively supports logging to json files which adhere to the standard suggested by [Gorsane et al. (2022)][toward_standard_eval]. This enables easy downstream experiment plotting and aggregation using the tools found in the [MARL-eval][marl_eval] library.

## Performance and Speed üöÄ

As the code in Stoix (at the time of creation) was in essence a port of [Mava][mava], for further speed comparisons we point to their repo. Additionally, we refer to the PureJaxRL blog post [here](https://chrislu.page/blog/meta-disco/) where the speed benefits of end-to-end JAX systems are discussed. Lastly, we point to the Podracer architectures paper [here][anakin_paper] where these ideas were first discussed and benchmarked.

Below we provide some plots illustrating that Stoix performs equally to that of [PureJaxRL][purejaxrl] but with the added benefit of the code being already set up for `pmap` distribution over devices as well as the other features provided (algorithm implementations, logging, config system, etc).
<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/ppo_compare.png" alt="ppo" width="45%"/> <img src="docs/images/dqn_compare.png" alt="dqn" width="45%"/>
</p>
I've also included a plot of the training time for 5e5 steps of PPO as one scales the number of environments. PureJaxRL does not pmap and thus runs on a single a device.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/env_scaling.png" alt="env_scaling" width="750"/>
</p>

Lastly, please keep in mind for practical use that current networks and hyperparameters for algorithms have not been tuned.

## Installation üé¨

At the moment Stoix is not meant to be installed as a library, but rather to be used as a research tool.

You can use Stoix by cloning the repo and pip installing as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdanToledo/Stoix.git
cd Stoix
pip install -e .
```

We have tested `Stoix` on Python 3.10. Note that because the installation of JAX differs depending on your hardware accelerator,
we advise users to explicitly install the correct JAX version (see the [official installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)).

## Quickstart ‚ö°

To get started with training your first Stoix system, simply run one of the system files. e.g.,

For an Anakin system:

```bash
python stoix/systems/ppo/anakin/ff_ppo.py
```

or for a Sebulba system:

```bash
python stoix/systems/ppo/sebulba/ff_ppo.py arch=sebulba env=envpool/pong network=visual_resnet
```

Stoix makes use of Hydra for config management. In order to see our default system configs please see the `stoix/configs/` directory. A benefit of Hydra is that configs can either be set in config yaml files or overwritten from the terminal on the fly. For an example of running a system on the CartPole environment and changing any hyperparameters, the above code can simply be adapted as follows:

```bash
python stoix/systems/ppo/anakin/ff_ppo.py env=gymnax/cartpole system.rollout_length=32 system.decay_learning_rates=True
```

Additionally, certain implementations such as Dueling DQN are decided by the network architecture but the underlying algorithm stays the same. For example, if you wanted to run Dueling DQN you would simply do:

```bash
python stoix/systems/q_learning/ff_dqn.py network=mlp_dueling_dqn
```

or if you wanted to do dueling C51, you could do:

```bash
python stoix/systems/q_learning/ff_c51.py network=mlp_dueling_c51
```

## Important Considerations

1. If your environment does not have a timestep limit or is not guaranteed to end through some game mechanic, then it is possible for the evaluation to seem as if it is hanging forever thereby stalling the training but in fact your agent is just so good _or bad_ that the episode never finishes. Keep this in mind if you are seeing this behaviour. One solution is to simply add a time step limit or potentially action masking.

2. Due to the way Stoix is set up, you are not guaranteed to run for exactly the number of timesteps you set. A warning is given at the beginning of a run on the actual number of timesteps that will be run. This value will always be less than or equal to the specified sample budget. To get the exact number of transitions to run, ensure that the number of timesteps is divisible by the rollout length * total_num_envs and additionally ensure that the number of evaluations spaced out throughout training perfectly divide the number of updates to be performed. To see the exact calculation, see the file total_timestep_checker.py. This will give an indication of how the actual number of timesteps is calculated and how you can easily set it up to run the exact amount you desire. Its relatively trivial to do so but it is important to keep in mind.

3. Optimising the performance and speed for Sebulba systems can be a little tricky as you need to balance the pipeline size, the number of actor threads, etc so keep this in mind when applying an algorithm to a new problem.
