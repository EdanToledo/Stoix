## Welcome to Stoix! üèõÔ∏è

Stoix provides simplified code for quickly iterating on ideas in single-agent reinforcement learning with useful implementations of popular single-agent RL algorithms in JAX allowing for easy parallelisation across devices with JAX's `pmap`. All implementations are fully compilable with JAX's `jit` thus making training and environment execution very fast. However, this requires environments written in JAX. Algorithms and their default hyperparameters have not been hyper-optimised for any specific environment and are useful as a starting point for research and/or for initial baselines.

To join us in these efforts, please feel free to reach out, raise issues or read our [contribution guidelines](#contributing-) (or just star üåü to stay up to date with the latest developments)!

Stoix is fully in JAX with substantial speed improvement compared to other popular libraries. We currently provide native support for the [Jumanji][jumanji] environment API and wrappers for popular JAX-based RL environments.

## Code Philosophy üßò

The current code in Stoix was initially **largely** taken and subsequently adapted from [Mava](mava). As Mava develops, Stoix will hopefully adopt their optimisations that are relevant for single-agent RL. Like Mava, Stoix is not designed to be a highly modular library and is not meant to be imported. Our repository focuses on simplicity and clarity in its implementations while utilising the advantages offered by JAX such as `pmap` and `vmap`, making it an excellent resource for researchers and practitioners to build upon. Stoix follows a similar design philosophy to [CleanRL][cleanrl] and [PureJaxRL][purejaxrl], where we allow for some code duplication to enable readability, easy reuse, and fast adaptation. A notable difference between Stoix and other single-file libraries is that Stoix makes use of abstraction where relevant. It is not intended to be purely educational with research utility as the primary focus. In particular, abstraction is currently used for network architectures, environments, logging, and evaluation.

## Overview ü¶ú

Stoix currently offers the following building blocks for Single-Agent RL research:

### Environment Wrappers üç¨
Stoix offers wrappers for [Gymnax][gymnax], [Jumanji][jumanji], [Brax][brax], [XMinigrid][xminigrid], [Craftax][craftax] and even [JAXMarl][jaxmarl] (although using Centralised Controllers).

### Statistically Robust Evaluation üß™
Stoix natively supports logging to json files which adhere to the standard suggested by [Gorsane et al. (2022)][toward_standard_eval]. This enables easy downstream experiment plotting and aggregation using the tools found in the [MARL-eval][marl_eval] library.

## Performance and Speed üöÄ

As the code in Stoix (at the time of creation) was in essence a port of [Mava][mava], for further speed comparisons we point to their repo. Additionally, we refer to the PureJaxRL blog post [here](https://chrislu.page/blog/meta-disco/) where the speed benefits of end-to-end JAX systems are discussed.

Below we provide some plots illustrating that Stoix performs equally to that of [PureJaxRL][purejaxrl] but with the added benefit of the code being already set up for `pmap` distribution over devices as well as the other features provided (algorithm implementations, logging, config system, etc).
<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/ppo_compare.png" alt="ppo" width="45%"/> <img src="docs/images/dqn_compare.png" alt="dqn" width="45%"/>
</p>
I've also included a plot of the training time for 5e5 steps of PPO as one scales the number of environments. PureJaxRL does not pmap and thus runs on a single a device.

</p>

Lastly, please keep in mind for practical use that current networks and hyperparameters for algorithms have not been tuned.

## Installation üé¨

At the moment Stoix is not meant to be installed as a library, but rather to be used as a research tool.

You can use Stoix by cloning the repo and pip installing as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdanToledo/Stoix.git
cd Stoix
pip install -e .
```

We have tested `Stoix` on Python 3.10. Note that because the installation of JAX differs depending on your hardware accelerator,
we advise users to explicitly install the correct JAX version (see the [official installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)).

## Quickstart ‚ö°

To get started with training your first Stoix system, simply run one of the system files. e.g.,

```bash
python stoix/systems/ppo/ff_ppo.py
```

Stoix makes use of Hydra for config management. In order to see our default system configs please see the `stoix/configs/` directory. A benefit of Hydra is that configs can either be set in config yaml files or overwritten from the terminal on the fly. For an example of running a system on the CartPole environment, the above code can simply be adapted as follows:

```bash
python stoix/systems/ppo/ff_ppo.py env=gymnax/cartpole
```

- üå¥ Support for more environments as they become available.
