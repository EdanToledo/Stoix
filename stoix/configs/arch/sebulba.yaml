seed: 42  # RNG seed.
total_num_envs: 120  # Total Number of vectorised environments across all actors. Needs to be divisible by the number of actor devices and actors per device.
total_timesteps: 1e6 # Set the total environment steps.
# If unspecified, it's derived from num_updates; otherwise, num_updates adjusts based on this value.
num_updates: ~ # Number of updates

# Define the number of actors per device and which devices to use.

  device_ids: [0] # Define which devices to use for the actors.
  actor_per_device: 2 # number of different threads per actor device.
  log_frequency: 10 # How often to log actor statistics.

# Define which devices to use for the learner.

evaluation_greedy: False # Evaluate the policy greedily. If True the policy will select
  # an action which corresponds to the greatest logit. If false, the policy will sample
  # from the logits.
num_eval_episodes: 60 # Number of episodes to evaluate per evaluation.
num_evaluation: 10 # Number of evenly spaced evaluations to perform during training.
